Simple channel frontend

To release a package, run php pearscs.phar release MyPackage.tgz handle,
then commit to the repository.

The live pear2.php.net site is automatically synchronized every 30 minutes from
branches/LIVE. To sync to live, you can use:

svn del http://svn.pear.php.net/PEAR2/sandbox/pear2.php.net/branches/LIVE
svn copy http://svn.pear.php.net/PEAR2/sandbox/pear2.php.net/trunk \
http://svn.pear.php.net/PEAR2/sandbox/pear2.php.net/branches/LIVE

Requirements - 
Savant3
Pyrus

Quick Setup:
cp config.sample.php config.inc.php
mkdir includes
php pyrus.phar `pwd`/includes channel-discover phpsavant.com 
php pyrus.phar `pwd`/includes install savant/Savant3
php pyrus.phar `pwd`/includes install Pyrus


Eventually Pyrus when we have 5.3 on the server  :-(
